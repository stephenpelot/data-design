Use Case: Sarah gets home from work, and boots up her computer. She types "www.reddit.com" into the address bar,
and is taken to the Reddit homepage. She sees a post entitled "A new way to bake a cake".
It catches her interest, and she clicks on the link. The website redirects her towards the article in question.
After the page loads, it displays a picture, and the related story. Sarah reads it, enjoys it, and decides to bookmark it
so that she can access it later. She clicks the bookmark icon, and the page is saved into her profile.
She then exits the site.
